  <h1>SentinAI: AI-Powered Cybersecurity Assistant</h1>
</div>

  **SentinAI** is a modern desktop application developed with PyQt6. It leverages Google Gemini AI models to perform two fundamental cybersecurity tasks: generating realistic password lists based on personal information (PassGen) and gathering open-source intelligence (OSINT). The application features a user-friendly interface with multi-language support (English, Turkish, Russian).

## Project Goal

This project aims to provide a powerful and accessible toolkit for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts. It combines complex command-line tools with the generative power of Google Gemini AI, presenting them in a single, intuitive interface.

1.  **PassGen Mode:** Creates comprehensive wordlists for social engineering and penetration testing, based on realistic, human-like password patterns tailored to a specific target.
2.  **OSINT Mode:** Automatically gathers, verifies, and compiles publicly available data (social media profiles, documents, etc.) about an individual or username into a structured intelligence report.

## Key Features

  * **Dual-Mode Functionality:**
      * **PassGen:** An AI-powered, realistic password list generator based on personal information (name, birthdate, city, etc.).
      * **OSINT:** Conducts extensive open-source intelligence gathering on a target using a full name, username, and keywords.
  * **AI Integration:** Google Gemini AI is used for critical tasks like data analysis, password derivation, profile verification, and final report generation.
  * **Multi-Language Interface:** Switch between English, Turkish, and Russian on the fly.
  * **Modern and User-Friendly GUI:** A clean and intuitive dark-themed interface designed with PyQt6.
  * **Automated Reporting:** OSINT investigation results, including verified data, are saved as a detailed analysis report in Markdown format.
  * **Asynchronous Operations:** Long-running tasks (OSINT, PassGen) are executed in the background without freezing the interface.
  * **External Tool Integration:** Automatically utilizes popular OSINT tools like `social-analyzer`.
  * **Web Verification:** Uses Selenium to verify the existence and validity of potential profiles found online.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to run this project on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.8+**
  * **Google Chrome** or **Firefox** browser (required for the profile verification feature in OSINT mode).
  * **Git** (for cloning the repository).

### 2\. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SentinAI.git
cd SentinAI
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries and tools.

**a. Python Libraries:**

Install all libraries at once using the `requirements.txt` file in the project folder.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install them manually with the following commands:*

```bash
pip install PyQt6 google-generativeai python-dotenv googlesearch-python beautifulsoup4 selenium
```

**b. `social-analyzer` Installation:**

This tool is used in OSINT mode to search for usernames across various social media platforms.

```bash
pip3 install social-analyzer
```

### 4\. Configure the API Key

This project uses Google Gemini AI services, which require an API key.

**a. Get an API Key:**

  - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
  - Sign in with your Google account and create a new API key.

**b. Create a `.env` File:**

  - In the project's root directory, create a new file named `.env`.
  - Add the following line to the file, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you obtained:

<!-- end list -->

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## How to Use

After completing all installation steps, run the following command in the main directory to launch the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Understanding the Interface

  * **Language Selection:** Change the interface language from the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.
  * **Mode Selection:** Use the central switch to toggle between **PassGen** and **OSINT** modes.
  * **Input Area:** Enter the relevant data here based on the selected mode. A placeholder text provides an example format for each mode.
  * **Execute Button:** After entering your data, click this button to start the task.
  * **Results Area:** The results of the task will be displayed in this section upon completion.

### Mode Usage Examples

#### 1\. PassGen (Password Generator) Mode

This mode generates potential password combinations based on known details about an individual.

  * **Example Input:**
    ```
    name=John, surname=Smith, birthdate=1995, team=lakers, pet=buddy, min_len=8, max_len=16
    ```
  * **Output:** The generated passwords are displayed in the list within the UI and saved as a `.txt` file in the `wordlists/` directory. You can select a password from the list and copy it to the clipboard using the "Copy Selected" button.

#### 2\. OSINT Tool Mode

This mode conducts open-source research on a target.

  * **Example Input:**
    ```
    John Doe, johndoe99, software developer new york
    ```
  * **Output:** Once the investigation is complete, a detailed intelligence report containing verified profiles, documents, and analysis is displayed in the results area in Markdown format. This report is also saved as a `.md` file in the `osints/` directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Interface (`app.py`):** The main application window based on PyQt6. It takes user input, delegates tasks to background threads, and displays the results in the appropriate format.
2.  **Mode Selection:** The user chooses between PassGen and OSINT modes using the `SimpleSwitch` (`custom_widgets.py`).
3.  **Task Manager (`Worker` Class):** Long-running processes like AI requests and OSINT scans are run on a separate `QThread` to prevent the UI from freezing.
4.  **API and Tool Management (`utils.py`):** Loads the Google API key from the `.env` file and checks if external tools like `social-analyzer` are installed.
5.  **PassGen Logic (`passgenai.py`):**
      * Takes personal information from the user.
      * Sends this information to the Gemini AI with a prompt that includes realistic, human-like password creation patterns.
      * Parses the JSON-formatted password list from the AI's response and saves it to a file.
6.  **OSINT Logic (`osintai.py`):**
      * **Entity Extraction:** Gemini AI extracts entities like `full_name`, `username`, and `keywords` from the user's input.
      * **Data Collection:** It searches for the username with `social-analyzer` and gathers potential URLs using Google Dorking techniques via `googlesearch-python`.
      * **Verification (Selenium):** Each found URL is visited using Selenium and a headless browser (Chrome/Firefox). The page content is then sent to Gemini AI to classify whether it's a genuine user profile or an error/login page.
      * **Reporting:** Only URLs verified as `VALID_PROFILE` are submitted to Gemini AI for final analysis. The AI synthesizes this data into a detailed, evidence-based, and structured intelligence report.
